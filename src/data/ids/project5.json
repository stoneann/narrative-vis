Classifier(int argc, char* argv[]).   \u00a0 : train_argc(argc), train_argv(argv) {.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 num_posts = 0;. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 unique_words = 0;. }. And then the private member variables for argc and argv only are written as.... . . private:.   \u00a0 int train_argc;. \u00a0 \u00a0 char* train_argv[];. For some reason, we are getting an error on train_argv[] despite every datatype matching up. We don't understand the problem and would really appreciate it if someone could please help us.\u00a0. .

Check @3301 for P5 Intro session recording and check this link for the slides that were presented for that intro session.. . Q: I've never worked with maps before.\u00a0 Where can I get a crash course about map functionality?. . A: Staff last semester made a p5 walkthrough video! Check it out here!\u00a0 In addition, another staff member made this video a few years ago detailing a general overview of what they are and how you can use them.\u00a0 In addition here is a playlist for additional help related to p5.. \u00a0. Q: Should I use my Map.h implementation in the driver?. . A: DO NOT DO THIS. Your implementation of Map is inefficient, and will cause problems down the road. Use the standard library implementation of map instead. (#include <map>) Great documentation can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/. . Q: I want to test if an Iterator points to a nullptr, how can I do this?. . A: You're probably trying to compare the iterator to nullptr like this: ASSERT_EQUAL(iter, nullptr);. Because these two aren't of the same type, the unit testing framework will probably complain. Instead see if you can compare two objects of the same type - Iterator - which have the same value.. \u00a0. Q: What is less? What is std::less<T>? How do I use less?\u00a0. . A: less is a private member variable of BST.. . It is an instance of a comparator class whose type is Compare. Compare is a template type. std::less<T> is a functor class in the stl that compares two elements of type T using the < operator. By default, Compare will be std::less<T>.. . In the BinarySearch_compile_check.cpp, there is an example of a BST with the default Compare and a BST with a custom comparator.\u00a0. . . In the first case, the template will be instantiated like\u00a0. Node *root;. std::less<int> less;. In the second case, the template will be instantiated like\u00a0. Node *root;. DuckWealthLess less;\u00a0. \u00a0. Q: What could be a cause of incorrect accuracy?\u00a0. . A: Make sure you're properly handling duplicate words. Make sure ties are properly handled. Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type.. \u00a0. Q: How do I record \"For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w\"?\u00a0. . A: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class.. \u00a0. Q: Why do my test cases compile on Caen but not the autograder?. . A: Double check that you haven't broken the public interface and added a public function. Also, do not put using namespace std in a header file.. \u00a0. Q: What's a csvstream and how do I use it?\u00a0. . A: There are three really helpful examples at https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream.. \u00a0. Q: Do we need to check for duplicates in our check_sorting_invariants_impl?. . A: Your check_sorting_invariants_impl checks for a valid BST. A tree with duplicates is not a valid binary search tree. The most definitive and unambiguous description of the invariant you need to check for is described in the sorting invariants section of the spec. To be extra clear, if you were to call check_sorting_invariants on a tree that has duplicates in the right subtree, it should return false.. \u00a0. Q: VSCode syntax highlighting is breaking on BinarySearchTree.h and Map.h!. . A: This appears to be a bug in VSCode 1.33 regarding default template parameters. We've found a few workarounds, probably the simplest of which is to add a comment to the template declaration:. . \u00a0. Q: How fast does my code need to run?. . A: You should aim for the large test case to run within a minute or so. For reference, the instructor solution takes about 5 seconds on this test case.. \u00a0. Q: My code is too slow. What might be the reason?. . A: Common sources of slowness include:. . Processing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).. . Iterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().. . Passing strings or containers by value.. . Iterating by value in a range-based for loop.. . machinelearning"}, {"id": 711, "value": "Hey all,. . If you've ever found starter file setup tedious, you will find this useful.. .

We\u00a0 thought we could be going out of bounds with our maxIndex, but then we realized through debugging with IAs that this couldn't\u00a0 be our problem because will be initalized within the acceptable range each time due to the code shown below:. maxIndex will simply take the index of the greatest value in tag_probabilities.. . We are asking for any extra help from IAs that may be experienced with Valgrind errors because we have been stuck at this point for days with no progress on the issue and are lost on what to do about this after going to many OH sessions with that unfortunately offered no resolve.\u00a0 Any help would be appreciated.\u00a0 Our uniqnames are \"elkinb\" and \"zakh\" if you would like to take a look at our last autograder submit to get a better feel for our code's structure.\u00a0 Thank you. \u00a0. .

I tried to explain what I was thinking, but that obviously can make this post a lot longer.\u00a0\u00a0. . Within the map.h file, if I want to implement the operator[] function, I know that one of my goals is to search through the tree to see if I can find a node with a key equal to the key passed in as one of the function parameters of the operator[] function. This makes me think that I will probably have to call the find(query) function implemented in BinarySearchTree.h on the tree member variable that I have added to the map.h class (line 123). The find(query) function calls find_impl(node, query, less) where less is a comparator used. My thought process was along the lines of the following logic:. . if(tree.find(k) != end()){. // return by reference the value associated with key. }. else\u00a0. {. // insert a new key with a value-initialized map value\u00a0. // return a reference to that mapped value. }. . My question is how can I pass k as an argument to the find function. The reason I am wondering if this is an issue is because the find_impl function makes use of the less comparator which often has the structure along the lines of less(node->datum, query). However in this case my query would just be a key where as node->datum should be a pair (an object that consists of both a key and a value). This makes me confused if I can even use tree.find(k) but I do not know how else to search through the tree and find a node with the same key value as the key passed in to the operator[] function.\u00a0"}, {"id": 1434, "value": "Are values on the left side of the root always less than the root value?

Q: Should I use my Map.h implementation in the driver?. A: DO NOT DO THIS. Your implementation of Map is inefficient, and will cause problems down the road. Use the standard library implementation of map instead. (#include <map>) Great documentation can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/. . Q: I want to test if an Iterator points to a nullptr, how can I do this?. A: You're probably trying to compare the iterator to nullptr like this: ASSERT_EQUAL(iter, nullptr);.

Instead see if you can compare two objects of the same type - Iterator - which have the same value.. \u00a0. Q: What is less? What is std::less<T>? How do I use less?\u00a0. A: less is a private member variable of BST.. . It is an instance of a comparator class whose type is Compare. Compare is a template type. std::less<T> is a functor class in the stl that compares two elements of type T using the < operator. By default, Compare will be std::less<T>.. . In the BinarySearch_compile_check.cpp, there is an example of a BST with the default Compare and a BST with a custom comparator.\u00a0. . . In the first case, the template will be instantiated like\u00a0. Node *root;. std::less<int> less;. In the second case, the template will be instantiated like\u00a0. Node *root;. DuckWealthLess less;\u00a0. \u00a0. Q: What could be a cause of incorrect accuracy?\u00a0. A: Make sure you're properly handling duplicate words. Make sure ties are properly handled. Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type.. \u00a0. Q: How do I record \"For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w\"?\u00a0. A: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class.. \u00a0. Q: Why do my test cases compile on Caen but not the autograder?. A: Double check that you haven't broken the public interface and added a public function. Also, do not put using namespace std in a header file.. \u00a0.

Q: Do we need to check for duplicates in our check_sorting_invariants_impl?. A: Your check_sorting_invariants_impl checks for a valid BST. A tree with duplicates is not a valid binary search tree. The most definitive and unambiguous description of the invariant you need to check for is described in the sorting invariants section of the spec. To be extra clear, if you were to call check_sorting_invariants on a tree that has duplicates in the right subtree, it should return false.. \u00a0.

However, I have no clue what I am iterating with and what I am iterating through. If I use a range based loop, is it nested to go through each word and also each post? Do I use if else statements?

Q: I've never worked with maps before.\u00a0 Where can I get a crash course about map functionality?. A: Staff last semester made a p5 walkthrough video! Check it out here!\u00a0 In addition, another staff member made this video a few years ago detailing a general overview of what they are and how you can use them.\u00a0 In addition here is a playlist for additional help related to p5.. \u00a0. Q: Should I use my Map.h implementation in the driver?. A: DO NOT DO THIS. Your implementation of Map is inefficient, and will cause problems down the road. Use the standard library implementation of map instead. (#include <map>) Great documentation can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/. . Q: I want to test if an Iterator points to a nullptr, how can I do this?. A: You're probably trying to compare the iterator to nullptr like this: ASSERT_EQUAL(iter, nullptr);. Because these two aren't of the same type, the unit testing framework will probably complain. Instead see if you can compare two objects of the same type - Iterator - which have the same value.. \u00a0. Q: What is less? What is std::less<T>? How do I use less?\u00a0. A: less is a private member variable of BST.. . It is an instance of a comparator class whose type is Compare. Compare is a template type. std::less<T> is a functor class in the stl that compares two elements of type T using the < operator. By default, Compare will be std::less<T>.. . In the BinarySearch_compile_check.cpp, there is an example of a BST with the default Compare and a BST with a custom comparator.\u00a0. . . In the first case, the template will be instantiated like\u00a0. Node *root;. std::less<int> less;. In the second case, the template will be instantiated like\u00a0. Node *root;. DuckWealthLess less;. . Q: What could be a cause of incorrect accuracy?\u00a0. A: Make sure you're properly handling duplicate words. Make sure ties are properly handled. Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type.. \u00a0. Q: How do I record \"For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w\"?\u00a0. A: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class.. \u00a0. Q: Why do my test cases compile on Caen but not the autograder?. A: Double check that you haven't broken the public interface and added a public function. Also, do not put using namespace std in a header file.. \u00a0. Q: What's a csvstream and how do I use it?\u00a0. A: There are three really helpful examples at https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream.. \u00a0. Q: Do we need to check for duplicates in our check_sorting_invariants_impl?. A: Your check_sorting_invariants_impl checks for a valid BST. A tree with duplicates is not a valid binary search tree. The most definitive and unambiguous description of the invariant you need to check for is described in the sorting invariants section of the spec. To be extra clear, if you were to call check_sorting_invariants on a tree that has duplicates in the right subtree, it should return false.. \u00a0. Q: VSCode syntax highlighting is breaking on BinarySearchTree.h and Map.h!. A: This appears to be a bug in VSCode 1.33 regarding default template parameters. We've found a few workarounds, probably the simplest of which is to add a comment to the template declaration:. . \u00a0. Q: How fast does my code need to run?. A: You should aim for the large test case to run within a minute or so. For reference, the instructor solution takes about 5 seconds on this test case.. \u00a0. Q: My code is too slow. What might be the reason?. A: Common sources of slowness include:. . Processing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).. . Iterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().. . Passing strings or containers by value.. . Iterating by value in a range-based for loop.. . Q: How can I check if a node equals nullptr? How can I set a node to nullptr?. A: You can check if a node is nullptr by: \u201dnode_ptr == nulptr\u201d or \u201c!node_ptr\u201d. You can create a node that is nullptr by doing \u201cNode* node_ptr = nullptr\u201d.. . Q: What does \u201cno matching function call\u201d mean?. A: This error means that some of your types or parameters to a function call are wrong. Let\u2019s take a function like the vector pushback function, which is used like this \u201cvec.pushback(5)\u201d. If you tried to call \u201cvec.pushback()\u201d it would get a no matching function call because there is no vector pushback function that doesn\u2019t take in any parameters. This same logic applies to constructors. Check the error to see what function is being improperly called and what parameters it takes.. \u00a0. Q: What is a false positive?. A: A false positive is when the test case passed on your code, however, it your code is still buggy. The test case passed because there was a logical error in your test case so that it wouldn\u2019t reveal the bug in your code. If you have one of these errors, I would suggest re-evaluating the logic of your test case. Come of office hours if you would like more indepth help on it!"}, {"id": 2325, "value": "Hi there.
