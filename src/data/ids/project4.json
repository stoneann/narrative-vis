The solution is friendship! We'll be covering friend declarations in the Iterator lecture.\u00a0. \u00a0. Q: Should I test the destructor/How do I test the destructor?. A: You should write tests for every function that you can. You're not responsible for testing the destructor in your test cases, but you should use a tool like valgrind to ensure that your code isn't leaking memory. You shouldn't call the destructor explicitly! The compiler does so automatically when the object dies.. \u00a0. Q: Why am I getting a segfault/undefined behavior?. A: Valgrind can be a helpful tool for tracking memory related errors. In general, a common cause for segfaults and undefined behavior in this project is uninitialized pointers. Make sure whenever you create a pointer variable (like first, last, or the members of a Node) that it is given a clear value. Valgrind tutorial: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_valgrind.html\u00a0. \u00a0. Q: Why does my test case compile on CAEN, but not on the Autograder?. A: Double check that you haven't added any public functions or made one that was originally declared private, public. Also, double check that you've not put using namespace std in a header file. Also, you can't compare an Iterator with a pointer.\u00a0 Also double check you've run your code in your terminal and on CAEN in case you accidentally created an unused variable.. . Q: How do I start api.cpp? What should the program look like?. A: Be sure to check out the project intro slides here.\u00a0 They include information that you may find useful when implementing api.cpp.\u00a0 Think about where you need to take input from, and what different things your program needs to be able to do with it. Then, break your code up into different functions or a class or whatever structure you'd like - just try and keep things organized, and don't just use one giant function.. . Q: On the style check I'm getting a \"memory is allocated but not initialized\" error whenever I create a Node.\u00a0 But I'm initializing my Node data member variables in the lines directly following.\u00a0 How do I fix this?. A:\u00a0 This occurs because the style checker sees that you create your Node on one line, but is not smart enough to check the following lines to see that you initialize the members of the newly created Node. This can be solved in a few different ways.. . Default constructing your members then initializing them.. . Node* n = new Node{};. n->datum = datum;. .... . Using brace intialization to create the new node.. . Node* n = new Node{next_in, prev_in, datum};. . Creating a default constructor for Node.. . We recommend options 1 or 2, since they are easiest to implement and integrate into your existing code. Option 3 is a little more complex, but good practice.. .

So I just started project 4, and although I assume that I am probably doing some things incorrectly, I have encountered an issue with my code that I can't quite figure out. As I have programmed it, when a POST /api/queue/head/ command comes in, the input is parsed and then sent a member function of the OHQueue class called \"push_back(json input)\", which itself creates a student object and then runs queue.push_back(student). However, it seems like after the OHQueue push_back() function runs, the queue list erases itself. Within the OHQeue push_back() function, I wrote a cout statement before and after running queue.push_back(student) that prints the size of the queue using list::size(), which shows that each time I run the function the length of queue always starts at zero, but does increase to 1 after running queue.push_back().. . There could be another bug in my code, but before messing around debugging, am I missing something? Am I not able to do queue.push_back() in that scope for some reason?.

Spec is here.. . The p4 intro session is on Wednesday, March 16th from 7-8 PM EST over Zoom. Please see post @4390\u00a0for more information.. \u00a0. FAQ:. . Q: What is a linked list/iterator?. . A: A linked list is another kind of container and an iterator is an object used to traverse and access elements in a container. You can refer to the lecture slides or the class notes (https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/) if you have any questions.. \u00a0. Q: Why am I getting an error related to accessing a private member of Iterator in a List function?. . A: By default private members of the nested Iterator class are not accessible to the List class. The solution is friendship! We'll be covering friend declarations in the Iterator lecture.\u00a0. \u00a0. Q: Should I test the destructor/How do I test the destructor?. . A: You should write tests for every function that you can. You're not responsible for testing the destructor in your test cases, but you should use a tool like valgrind to ensure that your code isn't leaking memory. You shouldn't call the destructor explicitly! The compiler does so automatically when the object dies.. \u00a0. Q: Why am I getting a segfault/undefined behavior?. . A: Valgrind can be a helpful tool for tracking memory related errors. In general, a common cause for segfaults and undefined behavior in this project is uninitialized pointers. Make sure whenever you create a pointer variable (like first, last, or the members of a Node) that it is given a clear value. Valgrind tutorial: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_valgrind.html\u00a0. \u00a0. Q: Why does my test case compile on CAEN, but not on the Autograder?. . A: Double check that you haven't added any public functions or made one that was originally declared private, public. Also, double check that you've not put using namespace std in a header file. Also, you can't compare an Iterator with a pointer.. . Q: How do I start api.cpp? What should the program look like?. . A: Be sure to check out the project intro slides here.\u00a0 They include information that you may find useful when implementing api.cpp.\u00a0 Think about where you need to take input from, and what different things your program needs to be able to do with it. Then, break your code up into different functions or a class or whatever structure you'd like - just try and keep things organized, and don't just use one giant function.. . Q: On the style check I'm getting a \"memory is allocated but not initialized\" error whenever I create a Node.\u00a0 But I'm initializing my Node data member variables in the lines directly following.\u00a0 How do I fix this?. . A:\u00a0 This occurs because the style checker sees that you create your Node on one line, but is not smart enough to check the following lines to see that you initialize the members of the newly created Node. This can be solved in a few different ways.. . Default constructing your members then initializing them.. . Node* n = new Node{};. n->datum = datum;. .... . Using brace intialization to create the new node.. . Node* n = new Node{next_in, prev_in, datum};. . Creating a default constructor for Node.. . We recommend options 1 or 2, since they are easiest to implement and integrate into your existing code. Option 3 is a little more complex, but good practice.. . Good luck and Happy coding!.

A: In general, a common cause for segfaults and undefined behavior in this project is uninitialized pointers.

Use your visual debugger as well as address sanitizers to help ensure every pointer is set to the correct value.. \u00a0. Q: Why does my test case compile on CAEN, but not on the Autograder?.

In my code if we call L1.insert(i2,3); and then L1.insert(i1,4); the first element in the list will be 3 and the 2nd element will be 4 because my insert works by first comparing the pointer in the iterator to \"first\", which in this case is nullptr.

Then, as the pointer in i1 is nullptr and the first pointer already changed (because now 3 is in the list), i1 will now be treated as \"past the end\" pointer, not first pointer even though I declare it with begin();.

This really saves us so much time when helping you whether it be looking up your code on the AG or doing anything exam related.. The p4 intro session to be determined.. . Q: What is a linked list/iterator?. A: A linked list is another kind of container and an iterator is an object used to traverse and access elements in a container. You can refer to the lecture slides or the class notes (https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/) if you have any questions.. \u00a0. Q: Why am I getting an error related to accessing a private member of Iterator in a List function?. A: By default private members of the nested Iterator class are not accessible to the List class. The solution is friendship! We'll be covering friend declarations in the Iterator lecture.\u00a0. \u00a0. Q: Should I test the destructor/How do I test the destructor?. A: You should write tests for every function that you can. You're not responsible for testing the destructor in your test cases, but you should use a tool like valgrind to ensure that your code isn't leaking memory. You shouldn't call the destructor explicitly! The compiler does so automatically when the object dies.. \u00a0. Q: Why am I getting a segfault/undefined behavior?. A: Address Sanitizers are a great way to see where memory leaks and undefined behavior are in your program, which is very common in this project!! Segfaults and undefined behavior are typically the result of not initializing your variables or having pointers that point to bad memory (example being data that has been deleted). If you see these errors, try using the Address Sanitizers (found at this tutorial) to help debug your program.. \u00a0. Q: Why does my test case compile on CAEN, but not on the Autograder?. A: Double check that you haven't added any public functions or made one that was originally declared private, public. Also, double check that you've not put using namespace std in a header file. Also, you can't compare an Iterator with a pointer.. . Q: How do I start api.cpp? What should the program look like?. A: Be sure to check out the project intro slides here.\u00a0 They include information that you may find useful when implementing api.cpp.\u00a0 Think about where you need to take input from, and what different things your program needs to be able to do with it. Then, break your code up into different functions or a class or whatever structure you'd like - just try and keep things organized, and don't just use one giant function.. . Q: On the style check I'm getting a \"memory is allocated but not initialized\" error whenever I create a Node.\u00a0 But I'm initializing my Node data member variables in the lines directly following.\u00a0 How do I fix this?. A:\u00a0 This occurs because the style checker sees that you create your Node on one line, but is not smart enough to check the following lines to see that you initialize the members of the newly created Node. This can be solved in a few different ways.. . Default constructing your members then initializing them.. . Node* n = new Node{};. n->datum = datum;. .... . Using brace intialization to create the new node.. . Node* n = new Node{next_in, prev_in, datum};. . Creating a default constructor for Node.. . We recommend options 1 or 2, since they are easiest to implement and integrate into your existing code. Option 3 is a little more complex, but good practice.. . Happy coding!. pinkedlists.
