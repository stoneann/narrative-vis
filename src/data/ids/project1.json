Q: I get this error when trying to run VSCode on WSL (error starting the pipe progam): \u00a0. . . A: Try changing:. . . \"pipeProgram\": \"c:\\windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe\",. to. . . \"pipeProgram\": \"/mnt/c/Windows/System32/bash.exe\",. in the launch.json. . Q: I\u2019m trying to debug my project with VSCode on Mac, but it\u2019s skipping all my breakpoints. What do I do?. . A: This is a known bug in the Microsoft C/C++ extension. Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension with the following steps:. . . In VSCode, go to the Extensions tab and search for \u201cCodeLLDB\u201d. . . Set your `launch.json` configuration to the following:. . . . { \"name\": \"(lldb) Launch\",. \"type\": \"lldb\",. \"request\": \"launch\",. \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/stats_tests.exe\",. \"args\": [],. \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",. }.

A: You can find a number of vector tutorials online that give a decent introduction. Additionally, here are some links to the ENGR 101 Runestone materials with an introduction to vectors in C++.
