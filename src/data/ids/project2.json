Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI. Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:Matrix width = # of columnsMatrix height = # of rowsInstead of using variables like \"i\" and \"j\" in your for-loops, consider using \"row\" and \"col\" so you don't get confused!Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorialQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function? A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?A: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.Q: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?A: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.Q: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive? A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases.\u00a0. . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm..

Also, the Matrix_at() function is (mat, row, column) so with the current code and parameter structure, if we wanted to create a 3x5 matrix, we would initialize it as matrix_init(mat, 3, 5) but then if we wanted to reference the last element, we would write (mat, 4, 2) where 4 is the row and 2 is the column, so the order is actually swapped.

Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI. Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:Matrix width = # of columnsMatrix height = # of rowsInstead of using variables like \"i\" and \"j\" in your for-loops, consider using \"row\" and \"col\" so you don't get confused!Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorialQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function? A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?A: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.Q: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?A: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.Q: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive? A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases.\u00a0. . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm..

Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI. Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:Matrix width = # of columnsMatrix height = # of rowsInstead of using variables like \"i\" and \"j\" in your for-loops, consider using \"row\" and \"col\" so you don't get confused!Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorialQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function? A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?A: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.Q: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?A: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.Q: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive? A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases.\u00a0. . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm..

Main Project Files Questions (Matrix.h, Image.h, processing.cpp, resize.cpp). . Q: When should I use the -> operator?\u00a0. A: For Matrix, use the -> operator when you are implementing functions only in the Matrix.h file. Good coding style keeps the direct access to matrix objects using the -> operator to a specific set of functions. We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. The same goes for Image and Pixel.\u00a0. . Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?. A: As explained in the previous question, you should only use the -> operator to directly access a type of struct in a specific set of functions. In Image.h functions and resize.cpp, if you want to access the width of a matrix, you can\u2019t use the -> operator, so we need a function.. . Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?. A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.. \u00a0.

Is there an error in the provided function?. A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.. . Q: Why do we need to create a copy of the image in remove_vertical_seam? How can we do it?. A: When removing a vertical seam, the image has to be smaller. Images are array\u2019s, which have a fixed size, so we have to create a new image that is smaller. We can then copy the pixels over one by one, removing the desired pixels as you go. Since we are passing in an Image pointer, we are passing an address to an Image object. We can then change the pointer to point to the new image object created. Write out a memory diagram to help visualize how this works!. \u00a0. Testing Questions. . Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?.
