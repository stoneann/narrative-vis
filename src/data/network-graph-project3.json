The left bower is always considered the trump suit! Let\u2019s say trump is hearts. That means the left bower is the jack of diamonds. If the led suit is diamonds, playing the jack of diamonds DOES NOT follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts).

Card.cpp. Pack.cpp. Q: Why won\u2019t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. . Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable \u201cCustom Working Directory\u201d and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. Player.cpp. Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. . You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class\u2019s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can\u2019t use it in the driver since it won\u2019t be part of the Player interface!. . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. . No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?. . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you\u2019ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn\u2019t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. .

If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Simple or Human player, go back and ensure you coded each of the required functions. If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Player, think of another way to code the function.

In the context of euchre.cpp, this function is called after the trump suit has been made. If the trump suit was made before round two of making, then some player must have ordered up the suit of the upcard, meaning that the trump suit will be the suit of the upcard. Now, the dealer must add the upcard to their hand and discard the card of least value. The value of the cards in their hand is judged in the context of a trump suit existing---that trump suit being the same suit of the upcard. This is works great.. . I am running into a dead end when considering how to evaluate the value of the cards in the dealer's hand when the trump suit is determined in round two of making, i.e. when the made trump suit is not the suit of the upcard. Inside the scope of SimplePlayer::add_and_discard(), only the upcard is passed in. Where previously we could assume that the suit of the upcard is the trump suit and judge the value of the cards based on that, we can no longer do so, as the trump suit that has been decided and is something different, presumable the next suit of the same color.. . How, then, should I resolve this issue? I could make a global suit type object to represent the current trump suit and call Card_less() inside of add_and_discard() using the global suit in place of the trump suit. I could change the parameters of add_and_discard() to include a suit object and pass in the trump suit that is decided in the scope of make_trump(), but I don't want to run into issues with the autograder. I can't write an alternative function because there will be no precedent to override in Player.h.. .
