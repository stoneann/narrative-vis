{"nodes": [{"id": 2760, "value": "Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2. Project 2 is due Friday, February 3 at 8pm.\u00a0 Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.. Spec is here.\u00a0. \u00a0. Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI. \u00a0. Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:. Matrix width = # of columns. Matrix height = # of rows. Instead of using variables like \"i\" and \"j\" in your for-loops, consider using \"row\" and \"col\" so you don't get confused!. . Main Project Files Questions (Matrix.h, Image.h, processing.cpp, resize.cpp). . Q: When should I use the -> operator?\u00a0. A: For Matrix, use the -> operator when you are implementing functions only in the Matrix.h file. Good coding style keeps the direct access to matrix objects using the -> operator to a specific set of functions. We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. The same goes for Image and Pixel.\u00a0. . Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?. A: As explained in the previous question, you should only use the -> operator to directly access a type of struct in a specific set of functions. In Image.h functions and resize.cpp, if you want to access the width of a matrix, you can\u2019t use the -> operator, so we need a function.. . Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?. A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.. \u00a0. Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected?. A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorial. \u00a0. Q: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function?. A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.. . Q: Why do we need to create a copy of the image in remove_vertical_seam? How can we do it?. A: When removing a vertical seam, the image has to be smaller. Images are array\u2019s, which have a fixed size, so we have to create a new image that is smaller. We can then copy the pixels over one by one, removing the desired pixels as you go. Since we are passing in an Image pointer, we are passing an address to an Image object. We can then change the pointer to point to the new image object created. Write out a memory diagram to help visualize how this works!. \u00a0. Testing Questions. . Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?. A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.. . Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?. A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. . Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file.. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases.\u00a0. . Q: When will project grades be released?. A: You will be able to see your score including the private tests on the autograder approximately a week after the project deadline.. . Setup Questions. . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.. A: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run. \u00a0.
