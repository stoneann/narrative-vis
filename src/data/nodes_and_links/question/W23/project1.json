Q: I get this error when trying to run VSCode on WSL (error starting the pipe progam):. . A: Try changing:. . \u201cpipeProgram\u201d: \u201cc:\\windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe\u201d,. . to. . \u201cpipeProgram\u201d: \u201c/mnt/c/Windows/System32/bash.exe\u201d,. . in the launch.json. . Q: I\u2019m trying to debug my project with VSCode on Mac, but it\u2019s skipping all my breakpoints. What do I do?. . A: This is a known bug in the Microsoft C/C++ extension. Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension with the following steps:. . . In VSCode, go to the Extensions tab and search for \u201cCodeLLDB\u201d. . . Set your `launch.json` configuration to the following:. . . { \u201cname\u201d: \u201c(lldb) Launch\u201d,. . \u201ctype\u201d: \u201clldb\u201d,. . \u201crequest\u201d: \u201claunch\u201d,. . \u201cprogram\u201d: \u201c${workspaceFolder}/stats_tests.exe\u201d,. . \u201cargs\u201d: [],. . \u201ccwd\u201d: \u201c${workspaceFolder}\u201d,. . }. . Q: VSCode/macOS: Why am I unable to view console output?. . A: Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension: https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_vscode.html#macos-1. . Q: I haven\u2019t worked with vectors before - are there any recommended resources?. . A: Check out the project 1 vector tutorial https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/vector.html. . Q: My output is not printing out\u2026what might be causing this? I am getting an \u201cInvalid Read\u201d or \u201cSegmentation Fault\u201d\u2026what might be causing this?. . A: This is caused by an \u201cAccess-out-of-bounds\u201d error. You are indexing past the valid elements of a vector and reading some unknown data! This is undefined behavior that computers handle differently (which is why this may fail on the autograder but not locally). Re-read your function and think about where it could index out of bounds.
