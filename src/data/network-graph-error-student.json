{"nodes": [{"id": 1, "value": "P3 Overview. Slides. Recording. . Euchre Rules. Q: I\u2019ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. . A1: Spec: EECS 280 Euchre Rules. . A2: Slides: Welcome to Euchre Afternoon. . A3: YouTube: How to Play EECS 280 Euchre with Simple Players. . Q: How come the left bower was played when the led suit is trump? Why didn\u2019t the left bower follow suit?. . The left bower is always considered the trump suit! Let\u2019s say trump is hearts. That means the left bower is the jack of diamonds. If the led suit is diamonds, playing the jack of diamonds DOES NOT follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts). If the led suit is hearts, playing the jack of diamonds DOES follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts).. Card.cpp. Pack.cpp. Q: Why won\u2019t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. . Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable \u201cCustom Working Directory\u201d and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. Player.cpp. Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. . You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class\u2019s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can\u2019t use it in the driver since it won\u2019t be part of the Player interface!. . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. . No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?. . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you\u2019ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn\u2019t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. . Q: I keep getting an error: \u201cerror: creating array of \u2018Player\u2019, which is an abstract class type\" or error: creating vector of \u2018Player\u2019, which is an abstract class type\u201d or \u201cAllocating an object of abstract class type Player\u201d or \u201cAllocating an object of abstract class to type Simple\u201d\u2026what does it mean?. . Player is an abstract class because it has at least one pure virtual function (see https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/10_Polymorphism.html#abstract-classes-and-interfaces for a detailed description). You cannot create an object of an abstract class so you may not create a Player object. If you haven\u2019t implemented all the player class functions in simple and human player, you also cannot create a simple or human player object because the simple and human classes inherit the pure virtual function.. . If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Simple or Human player, go back and ensure you coded each of the required functions. If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Player, think of another way to code the function. There are no instances where you should be creating a Player because none of it;s functions are implemented. Note: you are able to create a Player* that points to either a Simple or Human player. This is because you are not actually creating a Player object, you are actually creating a Simple or Human player object.. euchre.cpp. Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. . This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you\u2019re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you\u2019re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.. "}, {"id": 3, "value": "A couple of questions with grading:\u00a0. . 1.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the euchre tests with solution card, pack, and player are using working versions of these files and therefore are only testing euchre.cpp. We did not pass any of these tests (presumably because of the whitespace error) and we were wondering if there is anyway to get some of these points back as if that was the only mistake we made it was very insignificant.
