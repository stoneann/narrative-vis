The easiest way to solve this problem, therefore, is to simply create a COPY of the Player's hand, and then sort and print the COPY. This way, we aren't actually altering any member variables of the class.. . This is the way I understood it, feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.. .

So, it turns out that the \"const\" modifier after the member function declaration (the \"const\" in \"void print_hand() const\", for example) essentially tells the compiler that the member function DOES NOT modify any of the member variables of the class being dealt with.. . Note that \"make_trump\" does not modify any member variables of any of the Player classes, and so is defined as being \"const.\" Functions declared as \"const\" can ONLY run other \"const\" functions, as otherwise they could potentially change member variables of the class (which is not allowed by the compiler). This means that \"print_hand\" must also be declared as \"const\".. . The issue here is with the sort function\u2014the sort function DIRECTLY CHANGES one of the member variables of the Player class (the Player's hand, namely), which is illegal. This is where the \"swap\" errors come in, since the swap function is TRYING to alter the \"hand\" variable of the Player class, but due to the \"const\" definition, this is illegal.. . To fix the issue, we CANNOT alter any of the member variables of the Player class in any way.
