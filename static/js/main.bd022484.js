debug your euchre program (specifically euchre_test01), we have provided an explanation for\xa0 each players decision making in each hand.. . Helpful Tips:. 1. If your player is playing or leading the wrong card, take a look at the play_card function, specifically how you compare cards and consider trump.. 2. If your player has the wrong cards in their hand, take a look at the shuffle function in pack.. 3. If your player is calling up trump when it they aren\'t suppose to (or vice versa), take a look at the card classification functions in Card.cpp (is_trump, is_face_or_ace, is_right_bower, is_left_bower).. 4. Make sure you ALWAYS account for the left bower. It is considered a trump suit not it\'s original suit. Ex: if hearts was trump, the J of Diamonds is considered a heart not a diamond.. . You can find the explanation in the publicEECS280 drive or by clicking this link."},{"id":3416,"value":"P3 Overview. Slides. Recording. . Euchre Rules. Q: I\u2019ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. . A1: Spec: EECS 280 Euchre Rules. . A2: Slides: Welcome to Euchre Afternoon. . A3: YouTube: How to Play EECS 280 Euchre with Simple Players. . Q: How come the left bower was played when the led suit is trump? Why didn\u2019t the left bower follow suit?. . The left bower is always considered the trump suit! Let\u2019s say trump is hearts. That means the left bower is the jack of diamonds. If the led suit is diamonds, playing the jack of diamonds DOES NOT follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts). If the led suit is hearts, playing the jack of diamonds DOES follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts).. Card.cpp. Pack.cpp. Q: Why won\u2019t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. . Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable \u201cCustom Working Directory\u201d and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. Player.cpp. Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. . You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class\u2019s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can\u2019t use it in the driver since it won\u2019t be part of the Player interface!. . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. . No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?. . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you\u2019ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn\u2019t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. . Q: I keep getting an error: \u201cerror: creating array of \u2018Player\u2019, which is an abstract class type\\" or error: creating vector of \u2018Player\u2019, which is an abstract class type\u201d or \u201cAllocating an object of abstract class type Player\u201d or \u201cAllocating an object of abstract class to type Simple\u201d\u2026what does it mean?. . Player is an abstract class because it has at least one pure virtual function (see https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/10_Polymorphism.html#abstract-classes-and-interfaces for a detailed description). You cannot create an object of an abstract class so you may not create a Player object. If you haven\u2019t implemented all the player class functions in simple and human player, you also cannot create a simple or human player object because the simple and human classes inherit the pure virtual function.. . If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Simple or Human player, go back and ensure you coded each of the required functions. If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Player, think of another way to code the function. There are no instances where you should be creating a Player because none of it;s functions are implemented. Note: you are able to create a Player* that points to either a Simple or Human player. This is because you are not actually creating a Player object, you are actually creating a Simple or Human player object.. euchre.cpp. Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. . This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you\u2019re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you\u2019re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.. "},{"id":3417,"value":"Hello everyone!. .

This is where the \\"swap\\" errors come in, since the swap function is TRYING to alter the \\"hand\\" variable of the Player class, but due to the \\"const\\" definition, this is illegal.. .

So I\'m confused on how we\'re supposed to include the constructor for the super class, and also how to fix the error that I get when trying to compile.. . You won\'t need a constructor for the superclass. Player is an abstract class that you would never make an instance of, instead, you make Simple and Human players. C++ by default will have an implicit constructor for the super class (super class is a Java term in C++ it is usually called the parent class). The subclass (again a java term, equivalently in C++ called child class) will inherit that constructor but as you can imagine, it is not enough. Simple player has a name that has to be initialized so you will need a custom constructor.. . .

Totally understand if this is a better professor office hours question, but I wondered if there are helpful strategies that you can suggest for projects?

"},{"id":7,"value":"Hello!. . My name is Gillian and my uniquename is jamesgil. I\'m asking this question on Piazza because all instructors are on here and I\'m not sure who predominantly deals with grading, but my enrolled instructor is Somayeh Molaei. Essentially, I want to ask if there\'s any way I can get any leniency in my Project 3 grade. I wouldn\'t normally ask for something like this, but I figured asking can\'t hurt, and I completely understand if \'no\' is the flat answer.. . Basically, I\'m feeling a bit screwed over by my partner for project 3 (uniquename jqnewman). We met in the first week after the project spec was posted and stubbed functions together, and throughout the project after that they were very unreliable. They seemed to have no availability to work on the project and took no initiative in the project for the first 2 weeks, and they did not respond to my texts often when asking if they could work on the project or if they could meet up. I proceeded to essentially write the entirety of Card.cpp, Card_Tests.cpp, Pack.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp on my own. The only thing my partner helped with was the shuffle() function in pack (which they wrote an implementation for, but it was not tested and did not work, so I had to finish writing it and testing it anyways), and they pasted the player_factory() outline from the project spec into player.cpp. They told me they would \\"pull their weight\\" during the final week of the project, and I had exams during the first part of that week so I chose to rely on her to begin the driver function. They were adament that working virtually worked better for them, so we did not meet in person. They did not start working until Thursday night, while I was finishing up player_tests.cpp, and then proceeded to tell me they finished writing the entire driver function! I thought, great, its at least close to done! However, when we tried to finalize things on Friday, our euchre.cpp was SO full of bugs and irregular behavior, and also did not account for a lot of the edge cases, so of course it was failing the tests. It took us all our time together Friday (which was limited because we both had classes, and she had IA office hours from 6:30 to 8) just to get the driver to compile, and by then we did not have enough time to fully debug before turning the project in. Also, all our style points were lost to euchre.cpp (which you can see in the autograder), which was, for lack of a better phrase, coded like an absolute mess.\xa0. . Basically, I\'m frustrated because i put a lot of work into carefully coding and testing all the helper function files, and it feels like a lot of that work has been lost because our driver function is an absolute mess, and one that I did not have enough time or notice to work through. Further, all the points in our final autograder submission were achieved from the files that I implemented, essentially by myself (Card.cpp, Card_tests.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp, Pack.cpp). Its generally disappointing because I was really looking forward to successfully coding a working euchre.cpp file, and I feel like the lack of planning, communication, and, imbalance of work on my partner\'s end prevented us from doing this. Arguably, I could have taken further initiative earlier on in the project and set us up for more success, but this was difficult to do when I felt bad for \'overtaking\' the project, doing more than my fair share of work, and doing more work without her affirmation or thoughts (since getting a response from her was very difficult).\xa0\xa0. . Without a doubt, I think its valid to assert that this poor project grade is a reflection of both my partner and I\'s lack of organization, but I can\'t help but feel that this lack of organization was very one-sided, and made it exceptionally more difficult for me to maintain an agenda that would lead to success. (ie, if I had done the project by myself, I could have made myself a schedule and followed it without being limited by another person\'s lack of organization and reliability). Regardless, I want to emphasize that I understand if there\'s absolutely no changes to my project grade that can be made, but I figured I would at least explain my situation, and see if there\'s any possible resolution.

I still failed the euchre.cpp public tests in the autograder for two reasons:. . 1) I didn\'t skip a line after printing the winners of the game. I did this because I was following the spec meticulously as we are told to do. For example, the spec is very detailed in telling us when to print new lines: \\"If a march occurs, print\xa0march! followed by a newline.\\", and \\"Print an extra newline when making, adding, and discarding is complete.\\" However, the instructions to print the winners are simply \\"When the game is over, print the winners of the game.\\" Since adding a newline wasn\'t mentioned, I didn\'t add it to my code but the autograders correct output has a newline.. . 2) In a case where both a march and a euchre occur, my code prints out \\"march!\\" but the autograder prints out \\"euchred!\\" The spec did not mention which to display in the case where both are true.\xa0. . Essentially, my code fully works except for a couple of very tiny syntax issues. It is complete before the 8:00 pm deadline, but I can\'t get full points because I can\'t submit after I\'ve submitted three times.

For me, Fran has Nine of Diamonds and Ten of Spades, and according to a Simple player strategy, it should print out Ten of Spades because when there is no lead suit we want the lowest card (in this case, lead is Hearts and trump is Diamonds), but the correct output is Nine of Diamonds.

Additional project slides for general overview and tips on the project: @1554.. \xa0. Q: I\'ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. A: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of \\"EECS 280 Euchre\\". Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc. 0:33\xa0Dealing. 1:55\xa0The Upcard / Making Trump Round 1. 5:35\xa0Making Trump Round 2. 7:20\xa0Leading the First Trick. 8:20\xa0The Other Players Play Cards in the First Trick. 10:58\xa0Deciding who Wins the First Trick. 11:24\xa0Leading the Second Trick. 12:00\xa0Playing the Rest of the Hand. 20:30\xa0Scoring. 21:23\xa0Determining Whether Another Hand should be Played - Ending. . Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class\'s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can\'t use it in the driver since it won\'t be part of the Player interface!. \xa0. This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?\xa0. Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you\'ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn\u2019t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but\xa0those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. \xa0. Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you\'re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you\'re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.\xa0. \xa0. Q: Why won\'t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable \\"Custom Working Directory\\" and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable.\xa0This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. \xa0. Q: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?. Follow\xa0this\xa0link\xa0\xa0and click on your specific IDE, then click on the \\"Arguments and options\\" subsection.. \xa0. Q: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?. Yes, according to the spec: \\"First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.\\". . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. .

The euchre public tests are run using your Card, Pack, and Player, while the euchre tests with solution are run with the correct Card, Pack, and Player provided to the autograder from the instructors. If this test is failing but euchre public tests is passing, it means your program as a whole is producing the right output, but your individual cpp\'s are incorrect. Most of the time, this is caused by putting cout statements in wrong places (for example, using cout in simple player functions when those statements should be in euchre.cpp). . 2. Why are the players playing their highest card when not following suit? . It is because they are following suit. The suit of the left bower is of the trump suit. For example, if trump is clubs and Jack of Spades is leading, that means the lead suit is clubs. This means if Mary has Ace of Clubs and King of Spades, she will choose to play Ace of Clubs to follow suit.. . 3. Why are the players playing their lowest card when they can follow suit?. Similar to the answer to Q2. If the left bower is in the hand of a player, the suit of that card is that of the trump suit, and this will affect whether they can/cannot follow lead. For example, if Uri has Jack of Hearts in his hand while Diamonds is trump, then that means he has a diamond card, not a heart card. . . 4. What am I supposed to cout in Player.cpp and euchre.cpp?. This is written in the spec, \\"Human Player Protocol\\" and \\"Printing Output\\". Essentially, cout statements (such as saying who won) that are used for both Human and Simple players should be in euchre.cpp, while cout statements specific to Human (such as listing out the cards in a player\'s hand) should be in Player.cpp in the Human class.. . 5. Why is my program giving me a runtime error saying I am trying to create an abstract class?. If you are using the dereference operator on Player_factory, the program tries to create a Player object, which is an abstract class. Since all of the functions in the Player class are pure virtual functions, this gives an error since the program tries and is unable to create a Player object. If you are using a vector of Player objects, use a vector of Player pointers instead."},{"id":1203,"value":". . When trying to compile euchre in ubuntu, this is the result I get.

Q: I\'ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. A: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of \\"EECS 280 Euchre\\".

Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class\'s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can\'t use it in the driver since it won\'t be part of the Player interface!. \xa0. This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?\xa0. Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you\'ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn\u2019t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but\xa0those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. \xa0. Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you\'re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you\'re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.\xa0. \xa0. Q: Why won\'t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable \\"Custom Working Directory\\" and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable.\xa0This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. \xa0. Q: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?. Follow\xa0this\xa0link\xa0\xa0and click on your specific IDE, then click on the \\"Arguments and options\\" subsection.. \xa0. Q: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?. Yes, according to the spec: \\"First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.\\". . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?.

Project 3 (full project) will be due on Friday, October 21 at 8pm EST. The spec can be found here.. From the FAQ:. Q: I\u2019ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. . A: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of \u201cEECS 280 Euchre\u201d. Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc. . 0:33 Dealing. . 1:55 The Upcard / Making Trump Round 1. . 5:35 Making Trump Round 2. . 7:20 Leading the First Trick. . 8:20 The Other Players Play Cards in the First Trick. . 10:58 Deciding who Wins the First Trick. . 11:24 Leading the Second Trick. . 12:00 Playing the Rest of the Hand. . 20:30 Scoring. . 21:23 Determining Whether Another Hand should be Played - Ending. . There will also be a euchre social on October 1st from 12 - 2 pm where you can get one-on-one help from IAs to learn euchre.. . Q: What do I have to submit to pass the checkpoint?. . The checkpoint includes all the files except the driver (Card.cpp, Card_tests.cpp, Pack.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp). It will make up 0.5% of your overall course grade.. . Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. . You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class\u2019s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can\u2019t use it in the driver since it won\u2019t be part of the Player interface!. . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?. . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you\u2019ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn\u2019t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. . Similarly: Q: I\u2019m getting a compiler error related to swap?. . This is the same question as the one above.\xa0 Use @1781 to direct students. . Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. . This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you\u2019re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you\u2019re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.. . Q: Why won\u2019t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. . Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable \u201cCustom Working Directory\u201d and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. . Q: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?. . Follow this link \xa0and click on your specific IDE, then click on the \u201cArguments and options\u201d subsection.. . Q: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?. . Yes, according to the spec: \u201cFirst, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.\u201d. . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. . No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat..

Helpful Tips:. 1. If your player is playing or leading the wrong card, take a look at the play_card function, specifically how you compare cards and consider trump.. 2. If your player has the wrong cards in their hand, take a look at the shuffle function in pack.. 3. If your player is calling up trump when it they aren\'t suppose to (or vice versa), take a look at the card classification functions in Card.cpp (is_trump, is_face_or_ace, is_right_bower, is_left_bower).. 4. Make sure you ALWAYS account for the left bower. It is considered a trump suit not it\'s original suit. Ex: if hearts was trump, the J of Diamonds is considered a heart not a diamond.. .

A3: YouTube: How to Play EECS 280 Euchre with Simple Players. . Q: How come the left bower was played when the led suit is trump? Why didn\u2019t the left bower follow suit?. . The left bower is always considered the trump suit! Let\u2019s say trump is hearts. That means the left bower is the jack of diamonds. If the led suit is diamonds, playing the jack of diamonds DOES NOT follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts). If the led suit is hearts, playing the jack of diamonds DOES follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts).. Card.cpp. Pack.cpp. Q: Why won\u2019t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. .

Q: I keep getting an error: \u201cerror: creating array of \u2018Player\u2019, which is an abstract class type\\" or error: creating vector of \u2018Player\u2019, which is an abstract class type\u201d or \u201cAllocating an object of abstract class type Player\u201d or \u201cAllocating an object of abstract class to type Simple\u201d\u2026what does it mean?. . Player is an abstract class because it has at least one pure virtual function (see https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/10_Polymorphism.html#abstract-classes-and-interfaces for a detailed description). You cannot create an object of an abstract class so you may not create a Player object. If you haven\u2019t implemented all the player class functions in simple and human player, you also cannot create a simple or human player object because the simple and human classes inherit the pure virtual function.. . If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Simple or Human player, go back and ensure you coded each of the required functions. If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Player, think of another way to code the function. There are no instances where you should be creating a Player because none of it;s functions are implemented. Note: you are able to create a Player* that points to either a Simple or Human player. This is because you are not actually creating a Player object, you are actually creating a Simple or Human player object.. euchre.cpp. Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. . This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output.

Where previously we could assume that the suit of the upcard is the trump suit and judge the value of the cards based on that, we can no longer do so, as the trump suit that has been decided and is something different, presumable the next suit of the same color.. . How, then, should I resolve this issue? I could make a global suit type object to represent the current trump suit and call Card_less() inside of add_and_discard() using the global suit in place of the trump suit. I could change the parameters of add_and_discard() to include a suit object and pass in the trump suit that is decided in the scope of make_trump(), but I don\'t want to run into issues with the autograder. I can\'t write an alternative function because there will be no precedent to override in Player.h.. .
